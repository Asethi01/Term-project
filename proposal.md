## **The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.**

>We want to create something that is useful and that we are also passionate about. We are both massive music fans and we understand the importance of playlists in today’s day and age. Certain playlists are designed for users based on their listening history and the certain “vibe” they are looking for. The main idea of the project is to create a program that analyzes the lyrics of several electronic dance music songs and then curate a happy playlist and a sad playlist based on the nltk sentiment analysis. 

>Some topics that we will explore is: text processing, text cleaning, dictionaries/lists/tuples, text analysis (nltk sentiment analysis). We want to create code that seamlessly analyzes the sentiment of the lyrics and curates a happy/sad playlist that people could potentially use in their daily lives.
Our MVP would be to have two playlists, one happy and one sad. A stretch goal of hours could be implementing a bit more nuance into the process. For example, we could create a “chill” playlist or an “exciting” playlist.

## **Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.**

>As we’re both students at a prestigious university in the U.S., we both understand the importance of an MVP/product. The product needs to be new and innovative, while also serving some sort of practical purpose. Therefore, we believe that the “vibe” playlist idea is definitely something that people can use every day to listen to music that fits their current mood. 

>>**John:** My personal goal for this project is to truly challenge myself. I know what the end product should look like, and it will be difficult to reach that goal through the utilization of Python. I am also looking forward to learning more about Flask and its capabilities. Flask is a really powerful tool that allows us to actually visualize how the Python code works.

>>**Abir:** My goals for this project are to be able to take all the learning I gained about extracting data from different data sources and python libraries from the previous assignments and be able to create a better end project in this assignment. I would like to delve deeper into the depths of different python libraries and maximize their utility.

## **Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.**

>We definitely plan on developing the Python code before even thinking about what the web page is going to look like. I think we are going to need to find an API that allows us to access the lyrics of songs. Once we can access the text, we would need to execute some sort of text processing that allows presents it in a way that the nltk sentiment analysis can work properly. After running the sentiment analysis for a song, the code would categorize the song as “happy” or “sad” based on whether positive or negative has a higher percentage. It will then add the code to the “happy” or “sad” lists, which would represent the two different playlists. There may be several nuances or other small steps that we need to do, however, as you stated, this part may be somewhat ambiguous, so it is hard to plan everything out when you’re not sure what types of problems you will run into. 

## **Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.**

>For this project, we have been able to create a rough schedule that we would ideally like to stick to. During the first week we want to try and gain as much information as possible about which data source we would like to ideally use. We would also like to try finding out more about all the different libraries that could help us with our project and understand their utility. 

>Next two weeks we would like to write our first few scripts of code and see if we are able to analyze the data as we hope to and divide it into different playlists. 
During the fourth week, we would like to add flask to our project and try and work on the web page of our project, making sure that it works well with our code.

>Lastly, we would like to spend our remaining time debugging our code and adding any more modifications we may think of along the way and might want to add. 

## **Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.**

>How we will approach this project will be by meeting in the beginning and talking through our ideas and approach ideas. Once we have decided on a way to proceed, we would like to divide the work and work on it separately and then meet again to review each other’s work and provide feedback or help if required. 
We chose this method of working together because we believe that by dividing the work and working separately we will be able to give each other enough time to work through the code at our own pace before asking for help so we can learn as much as possible. We will also hold each other accountable for effective communication. 

## **Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?**

>The most significant threat to our project may be not being able to find a credible data source that would give us access to different music to analyze for free. Another threat could be, us not being able to generate good enough analysis from nltk to classify the music into playlists.

## **Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?**

>It would be beneficial to learn how to create meaningful data from the different data sources.
