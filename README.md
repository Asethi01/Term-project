# Code Instructions 
This is a program that asks the user for song inputs and categorizes them into playlists using sentiment analysis. Upon running the code, the user will be prompted to input their song choices, after that the program will categorize it into different playlists and print them. Later, the user has the option to see any of the lyrics of the songs from either playlists. To run this code the user will need to install the lyricsgenius package and the NLTK Sentiment package.
